## Scripts

To interact with the blockchain, we provided a number of [useful CosmJS scripts](https://github.com/wynd-answers/wynd-app/tree/main/src/scripts). In particular the following are used to set up the system:

* `junox-facuet/start.sh` - runs a CosmJS faucet (API server) to serve out JUNOX to all users
* `upload_contracts.js` - uploads the various cosmwasm contracts and gets a code id for each
* `init_wynd_token.js` - creates a cw20 token called WYND and initial distribution
* `init_faucet.js` - creates a smart contract faucet so testers can get WYND automatically
* `init_wynd_invest.js` - configures and installs the investment contract

And the following interact with it (mainly for debugging):

* `submit_oracle.js` - run by an oracle server to inform the blockchain of the most recent data from the data platform
* `invest.js` - to manually make an investment (testing)
* `query_invest.js` - to perform some queries and ensure it works as intended
