Wynd is an example of an environmental DeFi app with the goal of channeling the DeFi funding
towards environmental goods. We had discussed many ideas related to tracking deforestation/reforestation,
and those would be wonderful projects to bring to production, but given the time constraints of the hackathon,
we decided on a metric that changed much more quickly... Air Quality.

The goal is to make visible the invisible - in this case air pollution - and allow people to profit when they can
reduce it. An investor can place WYND tokens on a given area and then work/lobby/tweet to improve the air quality.
Several months later when the investment is mature, we compare the new air quality with the original quality and
reward the investor with a return based on the change. If the pollution levels decrease, they get more WYND back.
If pollution increases, they lose WYND (do not get all their initial investment back).

For the prototype, we have a quite short investment duration (2 days) just to serve as a quick to use demo,
but any real system should configure this for several months and use a time-averaged value to encourage long-term improvements
